## Fast & SlowPointers (Tortoise and Hare)

### Tips of recognizing these problems:
* The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array
* When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic linked list), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. 
The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

## Common problems:

Linked List Cycle (easy)
Palindrome Linked List (medium)
Cycle in a Circular Array (hard)
